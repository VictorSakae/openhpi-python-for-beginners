    "The stopping distance of a car can be calculated using the following rule of thumb:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The stopping distance of the car is the sum of the reaction path and the brake distance\n",
    "- The reaction path depends on the speed. It can be calculated by the following rule of thumb: The reaction path in meter is equal to the speed in km/h times 3/10. - Example: Speed 50km/h –> reaction path 15m\n",
    "- The brake distance depends as well on the speed. Again there is a rule of thumb which is: brake distance in m is equal to the speed in km/h divided by 10, the result has to be taken by the power of 2 - Example: Speed 50km/h –> (50 / 10)**2 = 25m\n",
    "- The stopping distance for a car with a speed of 50km/h is 15m + 25m = 40m\n",

    "Implement the following functions to calculate the stopping distance\n",
    "\n",
    "- function reaction_path() which gets the speed in km/h as input, calculates the reaction path according to the above rule of thumb and returns the path in m\n",
    "- function brake_distance() which gets the speed in km/h as input, calculates the brake distance according to the above rule of thumb and returns the distance in m\n",
    "- function stopping_distance() which gets the speed in km/h as input, calls the above functions, adds their return values and returns this sum\n",
