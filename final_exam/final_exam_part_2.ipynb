    "# Wordle in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task for the final assignment is to implement a [Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle)\n",
    "clone in Python. The basis for your version of Wordle is the file\n",
    "`5_letter_words.txt` [[1]](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb.html).\n",
    "It contains more than 5.700 five letter words. In order to build your\n",
    "version of Wordle perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement a function `word_list()` that reads the `5_letter_words.txt` file and returns a list\n",
    "   of the words in the file.\n",
    "1. Implement a function `random_word()` that takes a list of words as a parameter and returns a random word\n",
    "   from this list.\n",
    "1. Implement a function `is_real_word()` that takes two parameters, a guess and a word list and returns `True` if\n",
    "   the word is in the word list and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "1. Implement a function `check_guess()`that takes two parameters. The first is the guessed word and the second is the\n",
    "   word the user has to find. `check_guess()` returns a string containing the following characters:\n",
    "   - `X` for each character in the guess that is at the correct position.\n",
    "   - `O` for each character in the guess that is in the word but not at the correct position.\n",
    "   - `_` for each character in the guess that is not part of the word.\n",
    "     For example, `check_guess(\"birds\", \"words\")` should return `__XXX`.\n",
    "   - If a letter is used twice in the guessed word and exists only once in the word to be found,\n",
    "     then only one letter in the return string is marked. In case one of the two letters is\n",
    "     positioned correctly, then this letter is marked with an `X` in the return string.\n",
    "     For example, `check_guess(\"carat\", \"train\")` should return `_OO_O`.\n",
    "     Another example, `check_guess(\"taunt\", \"train\")` should return `XO_O_`\n",
    "1. Implement a function `next_guess()` that takes a word list as a parameter. The function asks the user\n",
    "   for a guess, converts the guess to lower case and checks if the guess is in the word list. If this is the case,\n",
    "   the guess is returned. Otherwise, the function asks the user for another guess.\n",
    "1. Implement a function `play()` that:\n",
    "   - Uses the functions `word_list` and `random_word` to select a random 5 letter word.\n",
    "   - Asks the user for a guess using the `next_guess` function.\n",
    "   - Checks each guess using the `check_guess` function and shows the result to the user.\n",
    "   - Checks if the users guessed the right word with six guesses or less. If yes, the\n",
    "     user wins and the function prints `You won!`. Otherwise the user loses and the function\n",
    "     prints `You lost!` as well as `The word was:` followed by word the user had to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example execution of the program:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Please enter a guess: aaaaa\n",
    "    That's not a real word!\n",
    "    Please enter a guess: bbbbb\n",
    "    That's not a real word!\n",
    "    Please enter a guess: hello\n",
    "    ____O\n",
    "    Please enter a guess: world\n",
    "    _OO__\n",
    "    Please enter a guess: story\n",
    "    O_OO_\n",
    "    Please enter a guess: hours\n",
    "    _O_OO\n",
    "    Please enter a guess: works\n",
    "    _OO_O\n",
    "    Please enter a guess: crops\n",
    "    _OO_O\n",
    "    You lost!\n",
    "    The word was: visor\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "And here is another example execution of the program:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Please enter a guess: hello\n",
    "    OO___\n",
    "    Please enter a guess: there\n",
    "    XXX_X\n",
    "    Please enter a guess: these\n",
    "    XXXXX\n",
    "    You won!"
