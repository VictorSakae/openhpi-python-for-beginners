    "# Compute π using a random number generator\n",
    "\n",
    "The number *π (Pi)* can be calculated using random numbers. Suppose you have a circle\n",
    "with radius 1 which is inscribed in a square with a side length of 2 (see figure below). Then the square\n",
    "has an area of *4 (2 \\* 2)* and the circle has an area of *π (r = 1*, thus *π \\* r² = π*).\n",
    "\n",
    "![complete circle, Pi][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "If thousands of points are randomly created within the square, then some points are\n",
    "inside the square _and_ inside the circle, others are inside the square and _not_ inside the circle.\n",
    "The situation can be simplified if you just consider the upper right quadrant of\n",
    "the above figure. This square has a side length of 1. Each point within the\n",
    "square can be described by the coordinates *x* and *y* where *(0 < x, y < 1)*.\n",
    "If *x² + y² < 1*, then a point specified by *(x, y)* lies within the circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "![upper right part of circle][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "As the relation between the sizes of circle and square is *π/4*, the relation\n",
    "between the points in the circle and the points in the square must be *π/4* as\n",
    "well. Using this formula, one can now use a random number generator to calculate π.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the library `random` create 10,000 random points inside the square.\n",
    "That means generate 10,000 random pairs of values for *x* and *y*. The random value must be between 0 and 1\n",
    "in order for a point to be inside the square.\n",
    "For each point check if *x² + y² is < 1*. If this is the case, then the point is\n",
    "within the circle. Count the total number of points and the points which are\n",
    "in the circle. Use these numbers to calculate *π*.\n",
    "Finally compare your calculated value of *π* with\n",
    "the value of *π* found in the `math` library. Do this by printing the calculated value of *π*, the value from\n",
    "the math library as well as the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example execution of the program. Note that your values might be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Calculated value of π: 3.1396\n",
    "    Value of π from math library: 3.141592653589793\n",
    "    Difference: -0.0019926535897929476\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Additional Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you solve the bonus exercise without a for loop using list comprehension?\n",
